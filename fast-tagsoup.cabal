synopsis:       Fast parser for tagsoup package
description:
    .
    Fast TagSoup parser. Speeds of 20-200MB/sec were observed.
    .
    Works only with strict bytestrings.
    .
    This library is intended to be used in conjunction with the original @tagsoup@ package:
    .
    > import Text.HTML.TagSoup hiding (parseTags, renderTags)
    > import Text.HTML.TagSoup.Fast
    .
    Besides speed @fast-tagsoup@ correctly handles HTML @\<script\>@ and @\<style\>@ tags, converts tags to lower case and can decode non UTF-8 XML for you.
    .
    This parser is used in production in BazQux Reader feeds and comments crawler.
